# Python-Motion-Detection


A tiny Python project made using [openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 

## Features
This app access your camera and detects movement of objects. As soon as an object moves, it takes a note of the time it entered the frame and when it left in a simple CSV file which can be opened with Excel. 

An HTML file is also created with a graph where a user can hover over the detections to be shown times. 

YOU NEED TO PRESS Q TO CLOSE CAMERA WINDOWS AND STOP RECORDING.
NO VIDEO/FRAMES IS SAVED ANYWHERE. 

The project was created as a practice app while learning Python and its functionalities are limited for the time being.
