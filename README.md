# Python-Motion-Detection


A tiny Python project made using [openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 

## Features
This app access your camera and detects movement of objects. As soon as an object moves, it takes a note of the time it entered the frame and when it left in a simple CSV file which can be opened with Excel. 

An html graph is also created. The user can hover over the detections to be shown time. 

The project was created as a practice app while learning Python and its functionalities are limited for the time being.
